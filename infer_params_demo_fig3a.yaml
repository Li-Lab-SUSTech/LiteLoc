Loc_Model:
  model_path:  '/home/user_name/save_model_path_demo_fig3a/checkpoint.pkl'  # Path of trained model.
Multi_Process:
  image_path: "/home/user_name/datasets/demo-fig3a/"  # Path of experimental data. If multiple files need to be analysed, you should set a directory path; Otherwise, please give a file path.
  save_path: "/home/user_name/liteloc_demo_fig3a_result.csv" # Path to save molecule list results.
  time_block_gb: 1  # Size (GB) of the data block loaded into the RAM iteratively, to deal with the large data problem.
  batch_size: 30  # Batch size for analyzing the sub-FOVs data for every GPU. The larger the faster, but more GPU memory.
  sub_fov_size: 256  # Size of sub-areas to be analyzed, must be a multiple of 4 (avoid error when down-sampling or up-sampling). If this is larger than whole image size, the entire image will be analyzed.
  over_cut: 8  # Overlapped area size of crop large FOV to sub-areas to avoid the incomplete psf pattern.
  multi_gpu: True  # If multiple GPUs are used.
  num_producers: 1  # Number of process to load and pre-process frames. Please set it according to the computation platform.
